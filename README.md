# Custom Vertical Slice Architecture in .NET 8
This project is a blend of both Clean Archtecture and Vertical Slice Architecture.
## Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy and architectural approach that is easy to maintain, test and adapt over time. The Core business logic should not depend on external frameworks, tools, or UI implementations rather all should depends of Core.
## Vertical Slice Architecture
Vertical Slice Architecture is a software design approach that focuses on structuring a system around "vertical slices" of functionality rather than traditional horizontal layers like presentation, business logic, and data access. Each slice represents a complete feature or use case, encompassing all layers required to deliver that functionality.
